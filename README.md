Rebirth
=======
A puzzle-solving game about a phoenix saving magical world trees from corruption
by the evil shadow foxes.  Centered around a simple mechanic:  the phoenix has a circular lifecycle
and each stage of its life garners different abilities, as well as weaknesses.  Death is inevitable and
does not hinder the player's progress.
